/**
 * This is an extension of the Silverpop Connector provided by the SilverpopConnector package.
 *
 * It overrides the parent class to return the SilverpopGuzzleXmlConnector rather than the
 * SilverpopXmlConnector.
 *
 * Using Guzzle rather than CURL means we can add listeners to the request and offer mock
 * responses during testing. The Guzzle class also has some additional functions submitted
 * in this PR https://github.com/mrmarkfrench/silverpop-php-connector/pull/25
 *
 * UPDATE to below - since writing this some patches I wrote have been merged upstream
 * and I feel positive about getting those things merged & switching back to the main repo.
 * I have retained these override classes for now but probably will switch back
 * 
 * Longer term I'm on the fence as to whether to simply improve the classes
 * in this package to the point where the dependency on the silverpop-php-connector package gets 
 * removed. There are a couple of things I don't like about the silverpop-php-connector package
 * 1) [UPDATE: have support for structure change to address this]
 *   The addition of api calls appears to be adhoc and, in particular, I feel like the choice of parameters
 * the functions take feels a bit arbitrary and it's not clear how you extend those
 * 2) [UPDATE: NO LONGER TRUE] Although the package is active I have yet to get a response to the PR I submitted.
 * 3) This is kind of really minor, but also quite a pain... The retention of trailing spaces means
 * I have to reconfigure my IDE to work with this code. It's not a convention I hit anywhere else.
 * 
 * On the other hand
 * 1) the package is quite active
 * 2) I think the way it wraps the different interfaces is quite nice. I did start with a different
 * package & switched to this as it seemed more developed & active.
 * 3) The intent of the Omnimail package is to wrap & standardise the underlying package for upstream use,
 * so there is no pressing need to change the underlying package.
