A simple PHP [Stomp](http://stomp.github.com) Client

Version choice
--------------
There are 2 Versions of stomp-php. 1.x is compatible with PHP <= PHP-5.2 as it
does not use PHP-5.3 specific features.

The master branch uses features such as namespaces and newer constants and will
become the 2.x release in the near future.

For versioning [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/) is used.

The different Versions can be found at the [tags](stomp-php/tags)
section.

Installing
----------

The source is PSR-0 compliant. So just donwload the source and add the Namespace
"FuseSource" to your autoloader configuration with the path pointing to

As an alternate you have the possibility to make use of composer to manage your
project dependencies.

Just add

    "require": {
        "fusesource/stomp-php" : "2.0.*"
    }
